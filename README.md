# TouchBoard 3.0 Pro (Abandonware)

This is the first commercial product I ever helped make. The company and the code are both lost to time.

## About TouchBoard

TouchBoard Pro was a cross-platform commercial desktop application I co-authored for people suffering from severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and other similar Repetitive Strain Injuries.

It was an on-screen keyboard and clipboard manager. The program presented users with customizable keys that could type anything from a single letter, to whole pages of content. It could even simulate the press of any key on a physical keyboard (such as tab, escape, arrow keys, and so on) allowing it to do more than just type text.

Users interacted with TouchBoard almost entirely by hovering their mouse cursor over the controls they wished to activate instead of clicking on them, with some exceptions due to limitations in the tool kit we used.

It was written using the Java programming language and was originally released and sold as [Shareware](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/shareware). Today the program is officially [Freeware](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/freeware). It was available on a number of Freeware hosting sites, but now seems to be lost to time. I'm providing my personal copy here for all who may find it useful.
